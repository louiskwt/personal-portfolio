# Hoksi HTML Manual

This is a simple Portfolio Page I created for myself

The layout is built completely with HTML and CSS.


## Usage
I built this project for my own personal use and it's also for the Free Code Camp's Responsive Web Design course.

## Project Status
In the future, I would like to come back and improve the UI for the project section as I continue to improve my web development skills.
